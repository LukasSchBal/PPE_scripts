This is a repository for the Product and Process Technology section in the Chemical Engineering Department at the TU Delft. Here we collect useful scripts which we develop within our research. Please follow our guidelines:

1. Please make sure that the code you provide is working.
2. Please make sure that the code you provide is well documented.
3. Please try to keep the examples as general as possible such that others can easily use them.

Maintainers for this repository are [Qinghe Gao](mailto:q.gao-1@tudelft.nl) and [Lukas Schulze Balhorn](l.schulzebalhorn@tudelft.nl). You can contact them in case of questions.

Happy coding!
